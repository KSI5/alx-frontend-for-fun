## Introduction

Flexbox is a one-dimensional layout method for laying out items in rows or columns. It provides a more efficient and predictable way to distribute space and align items.

## Getting Started

To start using Flexbox in your ALX project, you can include the following CSS in your stylesheets:

```css
.container {
  display: flex;
  justify-content: center;
  align-items: center;
}

.item {
  flex: 1;
}
```

## Basic Concepts

- **Flex Container:** The parent element with `display: flex` or `display: inline-flex`.
- **Flex Items:** The children of the flex container.
- **Main Axis:** The primary axis along which flex items are distributed.
- **Cross Axis:** The perpendicular axis to the main axis.

## Usage

To use Flexbox, apply the appropriate flex properties to your container and items. Some commonly used properties include `display`, `flex`, `justify-content`, and `align-items`.

## Examples
